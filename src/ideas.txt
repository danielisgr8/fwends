secret hitler
	at beginning you get told you are liberal or fascist (or secret hitler)
	you choose whether to lie or not
	option to start over at the end
	
	liberal
		truth
			nobody trusts you, [] kills you
			you form a powerful lib gang with other potential liberals
				turns out, all of them were lying and you lose
				turns out, [] was lying about being a liberal, you lose
				lib gang never lies, you win
			[] is immediately suspicious of you for no reason and convinces [] to kill you later in the game
			you do basically nothing all game and win
		lie
			you get killed because people think you're a facist. after the game, when everyone finds out you lied, [] throws you out the window
			for some reason lying made [] super sure you're a liberal. you win
		either
			
	facist
		truth
			you join trendy facists, the leader being [], and win
			nobody believes you had the confidence to tell the truth, so you fly by undetected and win
		lie
			you infiltrate the lib gang, easily convincing [] of your innocence, and win
			you quickly convince [] you're liberal and use it the win the game
			[] asks you a question and you laugh while answering. this blows your cover and you lose
		either
			you somehow kill hitler even though you knew who he was and lose
	either
		everyone yells way too much, so nobody /really/ wins
		rachel's laminated cards are a delight to the touch, making everyone playing a winner
